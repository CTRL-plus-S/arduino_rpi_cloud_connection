# cloud_rpi_arduino_connection
Here we create connection between many Arduino boards with the cloud through the RPi.

As a result, the data is read from radio module connected to usb port of raspberry and it is sent to the cloud
also being written to csv locally.

For more info see the documentation part in the "RPi-data-read.py" file
